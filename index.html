      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Worked in various marketing roles for the last 20 years, mostly in the aviation industry.  Whilst I loved my job it was long hours and lots of travel 
        and I'd prefer to stay closer to home with my daughter.  PLUS pretty much everyone I know lost their jobs so I think it will be a while before things 
        are back to normal - thank you covid.</p>
